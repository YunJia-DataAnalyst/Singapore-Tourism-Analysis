### **Description of Dataset**

This analysis leverages two comprehensive datasets from the Department of Statistics Singapore (SingStat) spanning from **2008 to 2024**. The data includes both **visitor numbers (demand-side)** and **tourism receipts (value-side)**, enabling a holistic analysis of market potential and yield per visitor.

### **Key Market Analysis: A Deep Dive**

* **USA: Long-Haul Market** The analysis of this market highlights a clear seasonal pattern in visitor arrivals and a strong post-pandemic recovery.
* **Indonesia: Short-Haul Giant** This drilldown showcases the unique characteristics of a high-volume, short-haul market, with a consistent pattern of frequent, repeat visits.

### **Key Insights & Observations**

* **Structural Shift:** Analysis reveals a clear structural shift in 2010 with the launch of the Integrated Resorts, leading to a 20%+ surge in both visitor arrivals and receipts.
* **Diversified Markets:** From 2012 to 2019, tourism grew steadily with broader contributions from long-haul markets like North America and India, showing successful market diversification.
* **Post-Pandemic Rebound:** The dashboard visualizes the severe collapse of 2020-2021, followed by a strong rebound in 2022-2024, with tourism receipts leading the recovery.
* **Shifting Demographics:** The data showed a gradual rise in visitors under 15 and over 65, indicating a growing trend in family and multi-generational travel.
* **Strategic Levers:** The analysis concluded with three data-backed strategic levers—focused on **long-haul growth, short-haul expansion, and local enrichment**—to guide future growth under the Tourism 2040 vision.

### **Technical Process & Learnings**

I created a robust data model in Power BI by unpivoting raw data in Power Query and using DAX measures to calculate key metrics. I then built a multi-tab report with an intuitive navigation bar and advanced functionalities like drill-throughs and visualizations (e.g., a profit waterfall chart) to tell a compelling data story. This project reinforced the principle that a strong data pipeline is the foundation of any effective analysis.
